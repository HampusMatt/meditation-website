## Testing

### Accessibility
This site was tested with LightHouse with the following score 

### Screen sizes
This site was deployed and tested for Google chrome and Mozilla Firefox, and ran as expected. The page was designed for screens >1300 px, <1300 px, <950 px and mobile <480 px. It provided the expected design at these screen widths, however, unfinnished problems regarding screen size will be discussed in the "Unfinnished errors"-section down below.

### Fixed bugs
Inititially, there was an error regarding getting pictures to load, where all but one picture failed to load at deployment. The only difference was the file-path taken for the different pictures, and when the filepath was rewritten to match the format of the picture that initially loaded, all pictures loaded as expected on both Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

### Unfinnished errors.
While the page loaded just fine and was styled as intended at the screen sizes suggested, further minimizing the site in the preview window seemed to brake the code. There was also a section between 950 px and 480 px that didn't look so good, however since these screens are for tablets and phones the transition between them were deemed to not affect the user experience.
