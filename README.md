### Meditation guides
These easy to follow guides are the essence of the page. Its set up with distinct lines so it's easy to follow along with clear headlines. The fontsize is big with some extra breathing space between each letter, but not so much that it becomes difficult to read.

### Screen sizes
This site was deployed and tested for Google chrome and Mozilla Firefox, and ran as expected. The page was designed for screens >1300 px, small screens at <1300 px, tablets at 950 px and mobile at 480 px. It provided the expected design at these screen widths, however, unfinnished problems regarding screen size will be discussed in the "Unfinnished errors"-section down below.

### Fixed bugs
Inititially, there was an error regarding getting pictures to load, where all but one picture failed to load at deployment. The only difference was the file-path taken for the different pictures, and when the filepath was rewritten to match the format of the picture that initially loaded, all pictures loaded as expected on both Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

### Unfinnished errors.
While the page loaded just fine and was styled as intended at the screen sizes suggested, further minimizing the site in the preview window seemed to brake the code, as seen in the mockup above. There was also a section between 950 px and 480 px that didn't look so good, however since these screens are for tablets and phones the transition between them were deemed to not affect the user experience.
