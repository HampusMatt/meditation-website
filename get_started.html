                <li>Sit down in a comfortable position.Â Read through the steps below, and start contemplating the fleating nature of existance.</li>

                <li>Imagine all the people in your life. All your relatives, friends, coworkers and relations. Let them all step up onto that stage. One by one. See them all there, crowded and smiling. Then let them all dissapear, fleeting away from you, never to appear again.</li>
                <li>Imagine yourself stepping up onto that stage. There you are, with all your hopes and dreams, with all your values and beliefs, with all the experiences that makes you who you are. Then let yourself dissapear, fading away into nothingness. </li>
                <li>Take a few moments to contemplate about the fleeting nature of existence, the fact that this is the path we all must tread. Then, when you are ready, open your eyes and return to the room. </li>
